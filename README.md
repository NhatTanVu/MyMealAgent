## Inspiration
MealAgent was inspired by a simple but common problem: people save countless recipes from cookbooks, YouTube, TikTok, and social media, but very few actually make it into the kitchen. Turning inspiration into a real meal often breaks down at planning, grocery shopping, or time management.
## What it does
MealAgent is an agentic AI cooking coach that turns online recipes into real meals. It reasons about ingredients, time, and servings to plan what to cook, generate grocery lists, send reminders, and guide users step by step, bridging recipe inspiration and execution.
## How we built it
The project was built as a mobile app using React Native with Expo, focusing on clean component structure and real-world UX. On the backend, there is an AI agent loop that ingests recipes from multiple sources (URLs, videos, images), normalizes them into structured data, and uses goal-driven logic to plan actions such as shopping, timing, and cooking guidance.
