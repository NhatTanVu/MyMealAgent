# MyMealAgent – Product Proposal

## 1. Problem

Millions of people save recipes daily from YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and food blogs. However, very few of those saved recipes ever get cooked.

The core issue is not a lack of inspiration — it is the friction between discovery and execution.

Common barriers include:

- Unstructured recipe content from videos or social media
- Time constraints and planning difficulties
- Uncertainty about ingredients already available
- Lack of grocery list organization
- Decision fatigue when choosing what to cook

As a result, users accumulate saved content without converting it into real meals. This leads to wasted inspiration, wasted food, and increased reliance on takeout or convenience options.

There is a clear gap between recipe discovery and practical kitchen execution.

- Social media users who frequently save cooking videos

### Secondary Audience

These users often consume cooking content but struggle with planning, organization, and follow-through.
